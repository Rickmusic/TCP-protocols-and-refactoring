    Divided up the workload of the conditionalDownloadURL method in class
    TCP Client. This method was extremely large and was divided into a
    method specifically for opening a socket connection a method to parse
    the URL and the conditonalDownload Method now only handles the actual
    HTTP IO.

    Removed duplicate code in TCPClient. This was very repetitive code that
    was solved using a simple if statement. Resulted in the loss of the
    TimeDownloadURL methods for one method ConditionalDownloadURL. Also
    unintentionally solved a little bit of shotgun Surgery.

    Slimed down the bloated large class that was UrlCache and created the
    class TCPClient the should handle the all the HTTP protocol and Internet
    retrieval stuff.
